# ðŸ¤– Fully Autonomous Daily Game Company

This project demonstrates a **fully autonomous, AI-driven micro SaaS** that generates, deploys, and promotes a new web-based game every single dayâ€”without human intervention. The system leverages **multi-agent orchestration (CrewAI, AutoGen, LangChain)** to coordinate specialized agents for content creation, marketing, billing, and analytics.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Vision

The goal of this project is to showcase the **next generation of AI-native companies**:
- **Autonomous Operations:** No manual coding or publishing required after initial setup.
- **AI-Generated Products:** Fresh, playable JavaScript games created daily.
- **Automated Marketing:** Intelligent agents post A/B-tested ads on social media platforms.
- **Microtransactions:** Automated billing at $1/day per active agent.
- **Data-Driven Optimization:** Persistent logs, ad metrics, and a global leaderboard to improve results over time.

### **Agents**
1. **Game Generator Agent:**  
   - Creates a brand-new HTML/JS game daily.  
   - Publishes it automatically to the web platform.  
   - Stores metadata in the database.

2. **Marketing Agent:**  
   - Posts ads on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit.  
   - Runs A/B testing to improve engagement (tracks clicks, CTR).  
   - Writes reports to persistent logs.

3. **Billing Agent:**  
   - Charges $1/day per active agent via Stripe API (or mock billing).  
   - Generates daily billing summaries.

4. **Simulation & Logs:**  
   - Runs a 3-day automated test to validate full workflow.  
   - Stores all actions in a database for transparency and analytics.
